It is been 8 years in my Job career as an infrastructure/DevSecOps engineer, I am much satisfied. But in the corner of my heart, I had the urge to learn programming so that I can relate my daily job to the developer program easily.

Everyone knows there are a lot of great programming languages and also suggested some. Finally, I was left with python and Rust. When I started comparing both the below fact sheet concluded that I should start investing my time in learning Rust.

The fact sheet:

Facts	Rust	Python
Learning curve	High (for a complete beginner)	Easy to learn
Execution speed	High	Much lower
Memory Management	Exceptional (no need for garbage collector)	Lower than
syntax	Statically typed.	plain English
Creating System tools	Very much recommend	Not Recommended
Popular in Developer	#1	#3
Stability	High	low
Documentation	sufficient	Sufficient
Pre-existing module	less (Developing)	A lot (plug and play)
type	Low level	High level

Out of all these comparisons, I loved the way Rust manage the Memory and the art behind the failsafe. I have heard of the pain of developers when it comes to the performance of the application and performing the right way to collect the garbage, it is no more in Rust. I was also fascinated to know how the most amazing tool like Kubernetes is programmed, So Rust was the right choice for me to take up. Though I know I will be starting programming from the scratch, and there will be a huge learning curve this year, I would try to learn as much as possible.

At the same time, I will be publishing my learning note as I progress with a self-assessment so that it would provide the reader with more insight.
Stay tuned in this series to learn along with me. Let's be closer to the system a bit more.
