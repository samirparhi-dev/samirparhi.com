Accessing Workloads behind a ingress-gateway always has been a  industry standard practice in Kubernetes setup. It facilitate single  entry point for all your services deployed in a production grade  Kubernetes. This setup also allows you to leverage the service-mesh  functionality of implementing policies and have a better authz and authn  to the deployed services. Meshery is no different, you can configure it  to be accessed through ingress gateway. Let‚Äôs see how can we configure  it.

#### Prerequisite :

- Kubernetes is up and running.
- Ingress controller is installed and Ingress-gateway is provisioned  (we will be taking istio into account in this example and it is  installed in istio-system Namespace)
- Meshery is installed in your Kubernetes cluster (Preferably in meshery namespace)


### See in Action:

#### Step 1 : Prerequisite check
Lets see if everything mentioned in prerequisite is fulfilled

<pre><code class="text-sm">
$ kubectl get svc -n istio-system                                                           
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                      AGE
istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   10.3.9.186   20.204.19.97    15021:30305/TCP,80:32107/TCP,443:32436/TCP   37d
We have ingress gateway provisioned.
$ kubectl get po -n meshery                                                                 
NAME                                    READY   STATUS           RESTARTS      AGE
meshery-5cc4489f77-7sbc5                1/1     Running             0          33d
meshery-operator-5db8b6c874-5cdvg       1/1     Running             0          33d
meshery-meshsync-8lb8b6y784-6ghnk       1/1     Running             0          33d
meshery-istio-6c56dd44fb-gk6xx          1/1     Running             0          33d
$ kubectl get svc -n meshery                                                                
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)          AGE
meshery                LoadBalancer   10.3.9.178   10.5.3.188   9081:31037/TCP   33d

</code></pre>

Now we see that Meshery‚Äôs core components meshery, meshery-operator, meshery-meshsync, meshery-istio (meshery adapter specific to your servicemesh), and meshery LoadBalance service (meshery) are up. The istio ingress gateway istio-ingressgateway is also up.

Note :
- you can observe that the CLUSTER-IP & EXTERNAL-IP of the Meshery LoadBalancer are private IP (10.5.3.188, 10.3.9.178) that means you can not connect it from the browser or outside of the kubernetes cluster.

- in the other hand if you observe we have got an public ip for the istio-ingressgateway (20.204.19.97) which can be accessed from outside of the cluster.

- Only way to access the Meshery is through our ingress gateway (which is part of ingress controller Istio in this case)

#### Step 2: Let‚Äôs create a istio-Gateway for this  meshery, which will facilitate meshey to recive the request from outside  of cluster to Meshery.

>Tip:  What is istio-Gateway?
>Gateway describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the mesh  receiving incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections. The specification  describes a set of ports that should be exposed, the type of protocol to  use, SNI configuration for the load balancer, etc. More information : Istio / Gateway.

create a file `meshery-istio-gw.yaml` and copy paste the below content to the file.

<pre><code class="text-sm">
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: meshery-gateway
  namespace: meshery
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"
</code></pre>

Now let‚Äôs apply this manifest in meshery Namespace.

<pre><code class="text-sm px-1">
$ kubectl apply -f meshery-istio-gw.yaml
</code></pre>

> Tip:
> Istio gateway is namespace scoped.  The gateway listener for meshery listens on port 80.

####  Step 3: Lets create a virtualService for Istio gateway to reach Meshery Loadbalancer in the kubernetes cluster

> üö© Tip: A VirtualService defines a set of traffic routing rules to apply when a  host is addressed. Each routing rule defines matching criteria for  traffic of a specific protocol. If the traffic is matched, then it is  sent to a named destination service (or subset/version of it) defined in  the registry. More info: Istio / Virtual Service.

create a file `meshery-istio-vs.yaml` and copy paste the below content to the file.

<pre><code class="text-sm max-h-64">
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: meshery
  namespace: meshery
spec:
  hosts:
  - "*"
  gateways:
  - meshery-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: /
    route:
    - destination:
        host: meshery
        port:
          number: 9081
</code></pre>
Now let‚Äôs apply this manifest in meshery Namespace.
<pre><code class="text-sm">
$ kubectl apply -f meshery-istio-vs.yaml

</code></pre>

> Tip: istio virtualService is namespace scoped.

#### Understanding `meshery-istio-vs.yaml`

When the request hits the istio ingress gateway (the gateway listener for meshery listens on port 80) with prefix ‚Äú/‚Äù (root) it will forward it to the kubernetes service meshery which exists in meshery Namespace and listing on 9081 (The default port of Meshery)

#### Step 4: Accessing Meshery:
Now you can access meshhery UI with http:/// in this context http://20.204.19.97/
Tip: when you hit http://20.204.19.97/ it will automatically redirect you to
http://20.204.19.97/provider and you will she the meshery UI as below:

#### Extras :
You can use fqdn (let‚Äôs say meshery.example.com) for accessing meshery. In that case you have to replace `*` field under hosts: section in `meshery-istio-vs.yaml` and `meshery-istio-gw.yaml` to `meshery.example.com` .
