We are Moving Fast! Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and especially Generative AI are revolutionizing industries. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the amount of information out there. But for newcomers, this flood of resources can feel like trying to drink from a firehose! 😅 

That’s when [s9lab.dev](https://s9lab.dev) was born! 🎉—what if we could create a one-stop hub that simplifies the exploration of open-source tools and technologies for contributors, developers, system designers, cybersecurity enthusiasts, blockchain buffs, and curious learners alike.

 [s9lab.dev](https://s9lab.dev) envisioned as a **Collection of collections** (think of bucket lists or arrays 😉), designed to guide you through cutting-edge resources related to AI, ML, and beyond, whether you're just starting out or diving into advanced topics.

## Available Collections Till Date:
