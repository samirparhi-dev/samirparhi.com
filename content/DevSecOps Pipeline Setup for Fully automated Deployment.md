Both pipelines help automate various stages of security checks, image verification, and deployment, making operations more efficient and secure."

This pipeline automates the process of building, scanning, signing, and deploying container images while ensuring compliance with security policies. Here's how it works:

**Code Base (GitHub):** The pipeline is triggered when a pull request (PR) is raised.

**Build Code and Container:** The application code is built, followed by container creation.

**Trivy Static Container Scan:** A security scan is performed to check for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

**Condition Check:** The scan results are analyzed. If the container passes, the process continues. If it fails, the team is notified via email or Slack.

**Attach Image Using Cosign:** If the scan is successful, the container image is signed using Cosign for added security.

**Upload Image to Registry:** The signed image is pushed to the container registry for deployment.

**Visualize with Grafana:** The metrics related to the build and scan processes are visualized using Grafana for continuous monitoring.

Infrastructure as Code Pipeline
This pipeline leverages IaC (Infrastructure as Code) and GitOps principles to provision and secure Kubernetes clusters.


#### IaC Pipeline Steps:

**Infra as Code (GitHub):** The process starts with version-controlled infrastructure code scripts.

**Release Candidate:** A PR is raised, signaling the release of the new infrastructure configuration.

**OpenTofu Script Execution:** The OpenTofu tool is used to apply the infrastructure changes.

**Provision Kubernetes Cluster:** A new Kubernetes cluster is provisioned using the approved configurations.

**Security Scans (Kube-Bench):** The newly created cluster is scanned for vulnerabilities using tools like kube-bench, Trivy, and others.

**Continuous Deployment:** After the scans pass, the infrastructure is deployed.

**Observability:** Metrics related to infrastructure health and security are monitored using Grafana and other observability tools.

**Improvements:** The pipeline continuously loops back for improvements based on the observability insights.
