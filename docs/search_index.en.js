Workloads behind a ingress-gateway always has been a  industry standard practice in Kubernetes setup. It facilitate single  entry point for all your services deployed in a production grade  Kubernetes. This setup also allows you to leverage the service-mesh  functionality of implementing policies and have a better authz and authn  to the deployed services. Meshery is no different, you can configure it  to be accessed through ingress gateway. Let’s see how can we configure  it.\nPrerequisite :\n\nKubernetes is up and running.\nIngress controller is installed and Ingress-gateway is provisioned  (we will be taking istio into account in this example and it is  installed in istio-system Namespace)\nMeshery is installed in your Kubernetes cluster (Preferably in meshery namespace)\n\nSee in Action:\nStep 1 : Prerequisite check\nLets see if everything mentioned in prerequisite is fulfilled\n\nNow we see that Meshery’s core components meshery, meshery-operator, meshery-meshsync, meshery-istio (meshery adapter specific to your servicemesh), and meshery LoadBalance service (meshery) are up. The istio ingress gateway istio-ingressgateway is also up.\nNote :\n\n\nyou can observe that the CLUSTER-IP &amp; EXTERNAL-IP of the Meshery LoadBalancer are private IP (10.5.3.188, 10.3.9.178) that means you can not connect it from the browser or outside of the kubernetes cluster.\n\n\nin the other hand if you observe we have got an public ip for the istio-ingressgateway (20.204.19.97) which can be accessed from outside of the cluster.\n\n\nOnly way to access the Meshery is through our ingress gateway (which is part of ingress controller Istio in this case)\n\n\nStep 2: Let’s create a istio-Gateway for this  meshery, which will facilitate meshey to recive the request from outside  of cluster to Meshery.\n\nTip:  What is istio-Gateway?\nGateway describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the mesh  receiving incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections. The specification  describes a set of ports that should be exposed, the type of protocol to  use, SNI configuration for the load balancer, etc. More information : Istio / Gateway.\n\ncreate a file meshery-istio-gw.yaml and copy paste the below content to the file.\n\nNow let’s apply this manifest in meshery Namespace.\n\n\nTip:\nIstio gateway is namespace scoped.  The gateway listener for meshery listens on port 80.\n\nStep 3: Lets create a virtualService for Istio gateway to reach Meshery Loadbalancer in the kubernetes cluster\n\n🚩 Tip: A VirtualService defines a set of traffic routing rules to apply when a  host is addressed. Each routing rule defines matching criteria for  traffic of a specific protocol. If the traffic is matched, then it is  sent to a named destination service (or subset/version of it) defined in  the registry. More info: Istio / Virtual Service.\n\ncreate a file meshery-istio-vs.yaml and copy paste the below content to the file.\n\nNow let’s apply this manifest in meshery Namespace.\n\n\nTip: istio virtualService is namespace scoped.\n\nUnderstanding meshery-istio-vs.yaml\nWhen the request hits the istio ingress gateway (the gateway listener for meshery listens on port 80) with prefix “/” (root) it will forward it to the kubernetes service meshery which exists in meshery Namespace and listing on 9081 (The default port of Meshery)\nStep 4: Accessing Meshery:\nNow you can access meshhery UI with http:/// in this context http://20.204.19.97/\nTip: when you hit http://20.204.19.97/ it will automatically redirect you to\nhttp://20.204.19.97/provider and you will she the meshery UI as below:\nExtras :\nYou can use fqdn (let’s say meshery.example.com) for accessing meshery. In that case you have to replace * field under hosts: section in meshery-istio-vs.yaml and meshery-istio-gw.yaml to meshery.example.com .\nFind it on  : \nLayer5 discuss forum\n\nCredits:\n Layer5 ,  Istio ,  Meshery\n","id":"https://samirparhi.com/configuring-meshery-behind-istio-ingress-gateway/","title":"Configuring Meshery behind ISTIO and ingress gateway"},"https://samirparhi.com/creating-a-aks-private-cluster-with-application-gateway-and-istio/":{"body":"Security has been a very key consideration in modern application architecture. When we talk about cloud-native application architecture, people tend to think about security a lot. That is why all the cloud providers have a bunch of features to make your application more secure and robust. For example, Azure provides various gateways like Network security groups, Application gateway, Azure front-door. These azure services provide a secure connection either by introducing a firewall or validating SSL certificates.\n\npeople say “Security is a myth over the internet\n\nAmong all the various way of the application deployment strategy, Most of the organisation has adopted or are adopting to containerise their application and run in a Kubernetes cluster. This adaptation is influenced by the features and the advantages provided by Kubernetes. Due to this popularity, all the cloud providers had also introduced the managed Kubernetes clusters. In the case of Azure, it is known as Azure Kubernetes services (aka AKS).\nIn this article, we will talk about how we can create a more secure infrastructure with the azure Kubernetes services and azure application gateway. It has all the information and detailed explanations to get your cluster bootstrapped and start serving your production workload. Let’s get started.\nPrerequisite\n\nYou should have a valid subscription and proper access in Azure to create an AKS service.\nEssentially, it better to have a dedicated resource group created for the AKS and you should have the owner permission to that resource group.\nUnderstanding of Azure private DNS zone.\nUnderstanding of Istio service mesh. In case you don’t know how to deploy, make use of Meshery (https://meshery.io/) which will install and configure the service mesh for you.\nShould know various K8s concepts essentially the POD, Services, Deployment, Namespace, Ingress Controller, and ingress gateway. Helm and kubectl should be installed.\nIdea about the CIDR block.\nOf course azure-cli should be installed and have an Idea to run az Command.\n\nNetworking Concept in AKS:\nBefore getting into the configuration, let’s understand the concept of networking used in the azure Kubernetes cluster which with ease our process of setting up the private cluster. Azure provides two kinds of networking in AKS namely kubenet and azure CNI.\n\nKubenet :  This is the default networking being used by AKS cluster. This by default takes care of all the networking behind the scene.\n\n\nNote: All AKS nodes get an IP address from the Azure virtual network subnet. Pods receive an IP address from a logically different address space to the Azure virtual network subnet of the nodes. Network address translation (NAT) is then configured so that the pods can reach resources on the Azure virtual network.\n\n\nAzure CNI: This is also termed advance networking. If you choose to go with the CNI route you have to do some more homework but the beauty is you can customize the networking the way you want. We will be using CNI in our context.\n\n\nNote:Every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. These IP addresses must be unique across your network space, and must be planned in advance. Each node has a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods that it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses per node is then reserved upfront for that node. You can configure the maximum pods deployable to a node at cluster create time or when creating new node pools. If you don’t specify maxPods when creating new node pools, you receive a default value of 110 for kubenet.\n\nIP planning\nAs discussed, Azure CNI assigns all the real IP to both Nodes and the pods from a given subnet space, So the Subnet should be capable enough to hold these IP ranges\nThe calculation below explains the min requirement of no IPs.\nAssumption :\n• We are creating a 3 node cluster - Means 3 IPs will be taken from the subnet assigned to K8s.\n• By default each node can have a max of 30 Pods i.e., 30*3=90 IP should be taken from the same subnet.\n• From a subnet, azure reserves 5 IP addresses for its internal use.\n• One extra node to be considered for the rolling update which will occupy 31 IPs (considering 30 pods per node by default)\n\nNote: Maximum Pod per node are limited to 250\n\nBy considering the above scenario, the subnet, where we want to create your K8s cluster, should have 90+3+5+31=129 IPs As our intention is to create the AKS Private cluster let’s see the private address spaces that we can use.\n\n✍🏼Tip: Below table shows Private address ranges available for consumption\n\nCIDRs :\nLet’s Design our CIDR for various network requirements of AKS cluster via Azure CNI Approach.   Vnet CIDR: 192.168.0.0/20 - total 4,096 Ips (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.15.255)   AKS primary Subnet CIDR: 192.168.0.0/21 - total 2043 IPs (192.168.0.0 - 192.168.7.255)\nTerminology Used in Azure CNI:\nVirtual network:  This is the virtual network, where you want to create your K8S Cluster. Here, I have taken my Vnet range as 192.168.0.0/20.\nCluster Subnet: This is the Subnet inside which your K8S cluster will be created. Please note that you Should create the subnet prior to create the AKS cluster and, it should have sufficient address space. The address space requirement explained at the beginning of this document. For example, I am choosing 192.168.0.0/21 range as my subnet for the cluster.\nKubernetes service address range: This is the  CIDR or IP range that is the K8S services will be using. Please note that this IP range must not be part of any of the subnets in your cluster. In simple words, it should be different from your subnet IP ranges. Important to note that this IP range should be in the range of your VNET IP range.\n\nFor example, this address range can not be in 192.168.0.0/21 range, as my cluster subnet is using it, but it should be in 192.168.0.0/20 range. So I am choosing 192.168.8.0/22 (total 1024 IPs (192.168.8.0 - 192.168.11.255))\n\nKubernetes DNS service IP address: This is a Distinct IP address from your Kubernetes service address range. Please note that this should be the first and last IP address of your Kubernetes service address range.   For example,  in Kubernetes service address range is 192.168.8.0/22. Kubernetes DNS service IP address can not be 192.168.8.0 or 192.168.11.255. So I am choosing 192.168.8.8.\nDocker Bridge address: this is the address range that will be used for docker bridge networking.\nFew things to remember :\n\nThis range should not be in the range of the Kubernetes service address range. In this case 192.168.8.0/22.\nAddresses matching the format ...0 or ...255 are reserved and cannot be used.\nThe prefix must be between 1 and 29.\nThe IP address cannot be the first or last address in its CIDR block In my scenario, I am choosing 192.168.12.2/28(total 16 IPs (192.168.12.0 - 192.168.12.15)), which satisfies all the above conditions.\n\nDNS name prefix: This is the DNS name that will be resolved for the API server of the Kubernetes cluster. You will use this FQDN to access your API server after you host your AKS cluster and the application.\nWhat is Azure Application Gateway?\nAzure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. This also provides the firewall capability to secure the traffic to your application. Below image from Microsoft documentation.\nOur Solution Architecture Diagram:\n\nExplanation:\nWhen users request for the website, it reaches the name server from where you have purchased your DNS (it can be azure or any 3rd party). From the name server, it finds A record and directed to the public IP of the Azure application gateway. When the request reaches the Application gateway, it validates the SSL certificate and runs the firewall rules too. then the Rules in the application gateway redirect it to its proper backend. The backend-pool for the application gateway is the istio ingress gateway. As we are constructing a fully private cluster (meaning all the IPs in the AKS cluster are private IPs) we have used DNS private Zone to implement a trusted connection between all the azure services in our VNET.\nPut things to Action:\nStep 1:\nCreate a resource group name k8s-rg in centralindia location (make sure to set the subscription first( here I am using my subscription named Azure)\naz account set --subscription \"Azure\" &amp;&amp; az group create -l centralindia -n k8s-rg\nStep 2: Create vnet and subnet in the above-created resource group.\n\n\nNote: I have used the CIDR that is discussed above. Please refer earlier section.\n\nStep 3: Now let’s get the ID of the subnet we created earlier\n\nyou will get the below output, save it for use in the next step:\n/subscriptions/&lt;subscriptionID&gt;/resourceGroups/rg-k8s/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/k8s-vnet/subnets/k8s-subnet\nStep 4. Let’s create our AKS cluster:\n\nStep 5. add node pool to AKS Cluster:\n\n\nNow the AKS cluster is ready.\nStep 7. Install Istio through Meshery.\nMeshery is an open-source, service mesh management plane that enables the adoption, operation, and management of any service mesh and its workloads.\nInstall Meshery through Helm: https://meshery.io/#getting-started (click on Helm icon to see the instruction to install meshery via helm)\nInstall Istio via from meshey UI: https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/istio\nStep 8. Making the ingress gateway internal By default the ingress gateway ( in this context Istio Ingress gateway) are internet-facing, meaning they get a public IP. In this case, we are creating a private cluster which means the cluster should only be accessed from VNET internally. To achieve this we have to make our Ingress gateway IP a private IP. This can be done by adding an annotation to our ingress service manifest. the annotation is as follows :\n\nafter applying the above annotation, check your ingress gateway IP now it is a private IP:\n\nStep 9:\nNow let’s create an azure private DNS zone and create a CNAME for our Istio Ingress gateway. So that the ingress gateway can be accessed via the azure network. More info on Azure private DNS (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-overview)\naz network private-dns zone create -g k8s-rg -n privatelink.centralindia.azmk8s.io\nin above the private DNS name is an azure defined name for the k8s services more info (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-dns)\nnow let’s add an A record for our istio ingress gateway so that it is discoverable by the application gateway in the Azure network. Go to the privatelink.centralindia.azmk8s.io private DNS resource that was created and click on recordset and add an ARecord as shown below and save it.\nWith this, we have successfully created a cluster and it is private. Now it can not receive any request from the web. But this is discoverable in the azure internal network as we have set up a private DNS zone. To enable the request from the internet let’s create an application gateway.\nStep 10. To create an application gateway, you need to create a Public IP first :\naz network public-ip create -g k8s-rg -n k8s-gw-pub-ip --allocation-method Static\nStep 11. Let’s create the application gateway now with the backend pool as the Istio ingress gateway.\n\nWith this, we have successfully created our azure application gateway and also the backend is set to the istio ingress gateway. Now the application gateway will be able to forward traffic to the istio ingress gateway and also get the response from the Istio gateway.\nCredits:\n\nI hope you like this blog post.

It is particularly important to have security measure in the Product. Now in the ever-increasing digital revolution, security flaws are really risk for an organisation as-well as the users. Though we cannot eliminate all the risks, we can always try to address most of them and the important CVEs. Earlier days these security considerations (Security headers in this context) are handled by application itself and coded by the developer in the application code but in the micro-service world it is especially important for developers to focus more on business logic rather than all these auxiliary tasks to reduce time to market of the product.\nThe good news is, now DevOps team can handle few of these features with help of Kubernetes, Iingress Gateways and Service Meshes. In this blog post we will focus on how to impose the mandatory security headers in Kubernetes NGINX ingress controller.\nOWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software, has recommended to below HTTP headers should be present by default.\nImportant HTTP headers:\nServer - this is the first header which we must impose so the Server label should not be displayed in the browser\nserver: hide\nX-Frame-Options - to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites\nX-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN\nX-XSS-Protection - stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\nX-XSS-Protection: 0 or 1\nContent-Type - Indicate the original media type of the resource (prior to any content encoding applied for sending).\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nX-Content-Type-Options - Avoid MIME type sniffing\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nStrict-Transport-Security (HSTS) - Enforce browsers that it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP.\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=&lt; expire-time-in-sec&gt;; includeSubDomains; preload\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload\nContent-Security-Policy (CSP) - mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src ‘self’ http://example.com\nCross-Origin-Resource-Policy - tells the browser blocks no-cors cross-origin/cross-site requests to the given resource\nCross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-site\nNow as we understood the mandatory security headers to be imposed to our application, let’s see how we can configure from NGINX ingress add the annotation nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: in the ingress manifest file (ingress.yaml )\n\nThere are also other interesting and useful annotation which you can checkout and I am sure it will enable you to add more features to your application.\nSources:\nmdn Docs\nNGINX Ingress controller\nOWASP Docs\nHope this helps.

Simply put, it’s change—a sustainable and universal reality. Every entity on this planet, whether it’s an individual, a business, or anything else, inevitably goes through pivots.\nWe tend to appreciate products that build momentum, and the same goes for businesses. Both continuously aim to gain momentum, which, in physics, is defined as the product of an object’s mass and velocity (momentum = mass × velocity).\nIn the context of a business or product:\n\nMass: could be seen as the complexity, features, or baggage of a product\nVelocity: could represent the rate of progress or adaptability\n\nLet’s correlate Physics and Business Metaphor:\n🚀 Momentum and Fabric Interaction:\nIf a product is too complex (heavy), it can become less adaptable, causing the business to struggle (tear the fabric). However, if it has a high rate of innovation or agility (velocity), it compensates for the heaviness, allowing the product to move forward despite the complexity. Let’s plot it :\n\n\n\nX-Axis:  Business relevance over time, The idea is that a product must continuously stay relevant in time by adapting.\n\n\nY-Axis: Rate of Change in Technology A higher Y-value indicates a company adopting more cutting-edge or future technologies.\n\n\nZ-Axis: (Rate of Product Innovation / Pivot): How frequently or drastically a product is innovating or pivoting.\n\n\nCase ① :\nA product overloaded with unnecessary features (high Z-value) can only succeed if it evolves and adapts very rapidly (high Y-value) to meet market demands. Without this agility, the excess weight of unused features slows it down, limiting its momentum on the time (X) axis.\nCase ② :\nA “light” product—small, focused, and purposeful—can pivot easily along the X-axis. Launching with a minimum viable product (MVP) allows for quicker adjustments and faster adaptation (moderate Y-value) without overburdening the product with unnecessary features (low Z-value).\nCase ③ : Shift on Y and Z Axes:\nMoving toward Y (cutting-edge technology) or Z (frequent pivots/innovations) in isolation can hinder progress. A product that is too futuristic (high Y-value) or innovates too frequently (high Z-value) may lose momentum because it loses focus or overextends resources on experimentation without bringing value.\n🈁 Classifying a Product :\n🪨 Heavy :\n\n\nToo many features but not enough users: The product is packed with features, but they aren’t reaching or being used by customers\n\n\nHigh upfront spending without enough research: A lot of money is spent early on without properly understanding the market.\n\n\nBuilding out of fear instead of demand: The product is created just to follow trends (FOMO) rather than addressing real customer needs.\n\n\nOutdated technology: The product isn’t keeping up with new technology or improvements in its tech stack.\n\n\n🚆 Light :\n\nPurpose-driven design: The product is built with a clear purpose, solving specific customer problems.\nFewer features, more users: Focusing on fewer, more essential features that users actually need and want.\nLow upfront costs: Managing costs carefully in the early stages, keeping spending low.\nFast feedback and quick adjustments: Getting feedback early on and adapting quickly, even before the product is fully launched, making it easier to pivot.\n\n🧠 Final Thought\nIn physics, space-time is a fabric that can bend, and similarly, in business, the passage of time and external forces (technology, market trends) can “bend” the business environment. A heavy product can warp this fabric, slowing progress. A light, nimble product moves more easily across it.\nHope you like it. ❀\n","id":"https://samirparhi.com/mastering-the-art-of-pivot/","title":"Physics in Product Metaphor: Navigating Momentum Through Pivot"},"https://samirparhi.com/parameters-to-consider-while-choosing-an-open-source-tool/":{"body":"When deciding on an open-source tool for a specific purpose, there are several key parameters you should consider to ensure the tool meets your needs and is a good fit for your project.

Users’ experiences are improved when they can build unique queries using user-controlled sources, which also gives them a sense of control and flexibility. This strategy has a lot of advantages, but it also has its share of drawbacks and potential problems.\nSecurity Concerns:\nThe security of user-controlled queries is one of the most important challenges. Malicious users could take advantage of security flaws like SQL injection, giving them access to the application’s data or the ability to change it. The following recommendation can be used to resolve this problem:\na. Input Validation: Thoroughly validate and sanitize user input to prevent unauthorized characters or SQL commands from being executed.\na. Parameterized Queries: When working with databases, utilize parameterized queries to avoid directly inserting user input into the query.\nc. The least privilege principle: Make sure that the database user for the application has the fewest rights necessary to carry out the needed actions, minimizing the possible impact of an attack.\nExample: The below method implements a Java example of Parameterised query:\nimport java.sql.Timestamp;\n//Include your main class here with method\n//The method declaration for update a product in a Schema\n\nHere ? denotes the positional parameters for syncedDate and user .\nComplexities :\nPerformance Impact:\nAllowing users to create complex and dynamic queries can impact the application’s performance, especially with large datasets. To mitigate performance issues:\na. Limit Complexity: Set reasonable constraints on the complexity and size of user-generated queries to prevent excessive database load.\nb. Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed query results, reducing the need to execute the same query repeatedly.\nc. Indexing: Optimize the database schema with appropriate indexes to improve query performance.\nData Integrity:\nWhen users construct their queries, there is a risk of retrieving inaccurate or irrelevant data, leading to skewed results or misinterpretations. To maintain data integrity:\na. Provide Guidance: Provide users with clear guidelines and tooltips to assist them in formulating accurate and relevant queries.\nb. User Feedback: Implement user feedback mechanisms to collect insights on the usefulness and relevance of query results.\nUser Experience and Usability:\nAn overly complex or confusing user interface can deter users from utilizing the query-building feature to its full potential. To enhance user experience:\na. Intuitive Design: Design a user-friendly interface with clear labels and intuitive controls to help users navigate and construct queries effortlessly.\nb. Query Previews: Provide a query preview feature, allowing users to see the results before executing the query.\nc. Error Handling: Implement informative error messages that guide users when their queries contain errors or return no results.\nCompatibility with Data Sources:\nThe queries built by users must be compatible with the underlying data sources. Different data sources may have varying query languages or capabilities. To ensure compatibility:\na. Abstraction Layer: Implement an abstraction layer that translates user-generated queries into the appropriate syntax for each data source.\nb. Data Source Validation: Verify and validate user-generated queries against the capabilities of the specific data source.\nConclusion\nThe ability to build queries from user-controlled sources has brought immense value to modern software applications. However, developers must remain vigilant about the challenges that come with this feature. By prioritizing security, performance, data integrity, user experience, and compatibility, developers can overcome these challenges and create a robust and user-friendly query-building system.\nEmpowering users with control over their queries can lead to higher user satisfaction, increased engagement, and a deeper connection with the application. Striking the right balance between flexibility and control while addressing potential issues will pave the way for a successful and empowering user experience.\n","id":"https://samirparhi.com/protecting-apps-from-sql-injection/","title":"Uncontrolled Data Used in Path Expression: A Cyber Security Threat"},"https://samirparhi.com/recursion-in-rust/":{"body":"Problem Statement:\nBuild a cli using Rust that can search a given string in all files in a directory and Sub directory Recursively.\nBuilding the logic:\nLets Search from the $PWD, However you can start from any directory you want .

We’ve integrated various freely available modules from diverse sources to expand our applications. However, we inadvertently overlooked verifying the authenticity of these sources.\nNowadays, with privacy concerns escalating across individuals and organisations, we’ve started scrutinising the origins of each code segment extensively. This scrutiny is aimed at ensuring that we can confidently deliver authentic products to our end-users without compromising on features while maintaining compatibility with other software.\nThe term SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) has become increasingly prominent in industry discussions over the past year. It’s likely that we’ll see a surge in demands for this skill set in the near future.\nSBOM is to establishing trust, much like how blockchain operates.\nFor instance, in a blockchain scenario:\nwhen purchasing a diamond ring, the blockchain ensures the authenticity of the product from its mining origins to its delivery to the customer, despite involving numerous vendors and steps in the supply chain.\nSimilarly, SBOM applies this logic to software. While we may utilise various modules or dependencies in our codebase to create impressive products, SBOM provides crucial information regarding the authenticity and vulnerabilities of these third-party components.\nSo, SBOM is for Whom?\nTechnically for Everyone (because privacy is our Rights not an option 😊)\n1. Primarily for developers, solution architects/Consultants, delivery partners,\n2. Companies or individuals consuming the software\n3. Vendors or agencies providing its ongoing support (AMC).\nFor whom it is a whistle blower?\nBased on recent analyses from various articles, it’s evident that there’s a growing trend towards embracing and promoting open source. While this is a positive development, the open nature of such projects means that they attract contributors and collaborators from around the globe who share their code. However, this openness also introduces potential risks. In some cases, developers may not adhere to best coding practices, particularly in popular codebases where thorough code reviews might not occur. Consequently, there’s a heightened risk of subpar code being committed to the codebase.\nWhat’s the solution then?\nIndeed, thanks to the global open-source community, initiatives have been taken to develop and promote SBOM tools, enabling meticulous scrutiny of each code segment.

The below few lines will describe how can you harden your security for accessing meshery so that you make eventually keep all your infrastructure sharing the same network are safe.\nThere are 2 scenario that people use meshery :\nA standalone installation (May be in a VM)\nA deployment in a Kubernetes cluster.\nIn general, each of the above installation method would need an IP (public/private IP) for you to access the meshery UI.\nTo Ensure you are securely accessing meshery below are the few point you should keep in mind.\nBest Practices:\nIt is perfectly fine to expose public endpoint / ip to evaluate Meshey provided the meshery is installed in a isolated environment (do not connect to any of the infra object in your landscape)\nIf you are installing Meshery in a standalone VM which share the same network of your other infrastructure object, we recommend not to Expose public IP. Instead use the VPN solution with a private endpoint to your meshery installation (the virtual machine). It is very easy to use the VPN solution if you are hosting it in any of the cloud platform\nIncase you are installing meshery in side a Kubernetes cluster (which is very common), By default Meshery uses the service type as loadBalancer which creates a public ip and exposes the Meshry service to outside cluster.\nThis default behaviour keeps in mind that you are evaluating Meshery at the moment . Also you acknowledge, you are well aware about the behaviour of kubernetes loadbalancer and its limitations.\nBut we recommend that you should always use the kubernetes service type clusterIp while installing meshery in a production grade infrastructure. It is doable by overriding values.yml if you are using helm installation method to install Meshery. It can also be done by the command line installation tool.\nNow you can make use of portforward or ingress component to expose and access the meshery services. However portforward can be used for meshery evaluation and for short term usage and ingress can be used to expose meshery from a prod/test/dev environment where you have ingress installed.\nThe above points are considered to be the more safe-way to use meshery in your infrastructure.\nYou can find the topic how to configure Meshery behind the ingress in this link: https://ls-lrt.com/configuring-meshery-behind-istio-ingress-gateway\nyou can find this blog here too : https://discuss.layer5.io/t/securing-meshery-installation-the-best-practices/679\n","id":"https://samirparhi.com/securing-meshery-installation/","title":"Securing Meshery Installation: The best practices"},"https://samirparhi.com/shell-script-for-migrating-azure-container-registry/":{"body":"When someone asks to migrate an ACR from one Azure subscription to another azure subscription, it feels like a tedious task.

When you describe it with an adjective, you define it based on that descriptor. The interesting thing about adjectives is that they’re not always tied to specific, measurable details. For instance, if you say the tree is tall, everyone understands the tree is tall, but how tall is subjective and varies from person to person, depending on their personal scale. For example, to me, a tree taller than 8 feet is considered tall, but for you, that might not be the case. You might think a tree over 10 feet is tall. Still, we both agree it’s tall.\nThis concept of subjectivity in adjectives can be closely linked to understanding statically typed programming languages and general-purpose programming languages (which are often dynamically typed).\n⏩ Statically Typed Languages\nLanguages like C++, Rust demand you explicitly define types upfront. This precision leads to optimizations that make them a solid choice for high-performance machine learning systems.\n⚡ Performance Benefits:\n\n\nCompile-Time Optimization: Just as a precise adjective removes ambiguity and potential miscommunication, statically typed languages catch many errors during compilation.Since types are known before execution, compilers generate highly efficient machine code, reducing CPU and memory overhead.\n\n\nEfficient Memory Usage: Explicit type definitions mean better memory management, allowing these languages to make the most out of system resources. It gives precision and prevents ambiguity.\n\n\nParallelization: Allow you to fine-tune control over CPU cores and even leverage GPUs and TPUs for heavy machine learning tasks.\n\n\n⚠️ Challenges:\n\nInflexibility: Requiring everything to be explicitly typed or defined can slow down development, especially for prototyping or situations where the types aren’t clear at the start.\nVerbosity: It adds extra code and complexity for things that might not need it in simple scenarios.\nSlower Iteration: Refactoring and iterating quickly might be harder when you need to make sure all types are aligned correctly.\n\n🐍 Dynamically Typed Languages\n\nFlexibility and Adaptability: Dynamically typed languages (like Python, JavaScript, Ruby) are more like using the adjective “tall” without a strict definition. They are flexible and allow you to work without having to define everything explicitly. This suits exploratory or rapidly changing contexts.\nEase of Use: You can be more casual in your descriptions (or code) without worrying about errors until they actually show up during runtime. This can lead to faster development in certain scenarios.\n\n🚧 Challenges:\n\n\nPotential for Miscommunication: Just as the word “tall” might mean different things to different people, in a dynamically typed language, the same function or variable can change in unexpected ways, causing confusion or errors.\n\n\nSlower Execution: Runtime type checking and interpretation add overhead, making dynamically typed languages slower in terms of raw CPU performance.\n\n\nHigher Memory Overhead: Without predefined types, dynamically typed languages often consume more memory, which may limit performance when handling large datasets.\n\n\nLess Optimization: Without knowing the exact types, compilers/interpreters can’t optimize as well as they could in statically typed languages.\n\n\n🧠 Case Studies\n1. Statically Typed Languages:\n\nMission-Critical Applications: Where errors need to be minimized at all costs (e.g., banking systems, aerospace software). The precision of static typing ensures that fewer unexpected behaviors occur.\nLarge, Complex Systems: Where maintaining clear structures and interfaces is essential for scalability. Static typing helps maintain clarity and prevents issues during refactoring.\nPerformance-Optimized Code: Static typing allows for better optimization during compile time, leading to more efficient runtime performance.\n\n2. Dynamically Typed Languages\n\nPrototyping and Rapid Development: Where speed of development is key, and the exact structure or types may not be fully understood in the early stages. Flexibility allows quick iterations.\nSmall or Medium-Sized Applications: Where the complexity is lower, and the risk of runtime errors is acceptable or manageable.\nData Science, Web Development, Scripting: Fields where flexibility and rapid changes are needed more than strict type enforcement. For example, many web frameworks in Python or JavaScript thrive on the ease of use provided by dynamic typing.\n\n📃 Summary\n\nStatically Typed Languages: Offer precision and safety but are less flexible and can slow down development in exploratory phases. They are suited for large-scale, performance-sensitive, or mission-critical systems.\nDynamically Typed Languages: Offer flexibility and speed but at the cost of potential runtime errors and less optimization. They are suited for prototyping, rapid development, and smaller-scale projects.\n\n💭 Open Thought\nCan Rust Be the Next Machine learning language ? or We train the Machine Using Python and Julia, then use them using Rust ?\n","id":"https://samirparhi.com/statically-typed-and-dynamically-typed-programing-language-intro/","title":"Battle of Programming Language: Statically Typed Vs Dynamically Typed ?"},"https://samirparhi.com/success/":{"body":"","id":"https://samirparhi.com/success/","title":"Success Response"},"https://samirparhi.com/the-gen-ai-tools-made-my-college-days-alive/":{"body":"This blog is a good read if you are still poking in to your mobile to read some interesting and relatable Tech stories. Here I share my Experience which resembles the way Generative AI is behaving these days.\nToday I was curious to understand and learn the behaviour of Gen AI. So, I was learning a topic on a Kubernetes policy tool Gatekeeper that implements Open policy agent (OPA) a well know CNCF project. As GenAI has been trending in these days I thought of taking help of two well known tool ChatGPT and Gemini.\nI spent good amount of time on ChatGPT and Gemini, In this 3 hours I started asking about basic Questions and it worked liked wonder. I thought I am with the best companion ever for learning.\nResemblance with Real experience:\nReminded me when I was a fresher and started giving my job interviews . I had all the theoretical knowledge and I was able to crak the first round and was high on confidence.\nThese flawless responses inspired me to explore further with more complex queries, hoping to have an insightful conversation. Instead, the tool responded with inaccurate information frequently, When I pointed out these inaccuracies, it responded with partially corrected statements, each reply was prefixed with “Apologies for the oversight”&lt; ……&gt;“.\nI realised AI brilliance can sometimes be deceptive..\nthis again mirrored moments from my interviews:\nDuring my second round of interviews, some of the interviewers were kind enough and allowed me to correct myself when I made mistakes. I cleverly navigated these situations by confidently prefacing my answers with, “Sorry, I just recalled”.as I heard somewhere “ you should be confident in the interviews even if you are wrong“. Interestingly this approach proven worked many times.\nAfter few conversation from these AI tools , my curiosity turned into amusement.\nAs I delved deeper, the responses began citing :“As of my last update in January 2022”,&lt;…&gt;\nDespite feeling frustrated and tired after almost 5 hours . I admired the confidence of these AI tools they were still eager to assist . ChatGPT’s Prompt was Continuously beckoning with “How can I help you today?”. Gemini Star blinks as though analyzing the forthcoming question’s response.\nSuddenly, few college days memories flashed in the back of my mind which was more relevance in this context of Gen AI tool.\nHere begins the Story :\nIt was the 2nd semester in my engineering (in 2009). Himanshu and I breezed through the semester until the exam schedule dropped. Usually we work hard day before the semester and struggled to avoid back papers 😁. thanks to those summery (Alok) book📖.\nLet me explain the hard work phase :\nSomehow, our hostel mates recognized Himanshu and me as the brilliant students, relying on us for answers to all their questions like ChatGPT or Gemini. We didn’t want them to feel hopeless. During semesters our hostel room was houseful, Some of them seemed to be Dull but they had hope on us.\nTo start with\nwe close the door and open YouTube and play a Verse from Bhagavad Gita . The most play one was chapter-2 verse-47.\n“Karmanye vadhikaraste Ma Phaleshu Kadachana |\nMa Karma Phala Hetur Bhur Ma Te Sango Stv Akarmani ||\nMeaning :\nYou have right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of actions.\nThrough this sloka, we inspire/ motivate them to at least fill up the answer booklet rather leaving it blank, at least you can hope to pass.\nNow everyone is energetic Ready to consume all the Knowlwdge like blackholes.\nI start reading the summery book📚 (Alok) and Himanshu illustrates them like the Krishna 🕉️.\nAs always there was no question or doubt. A classy example of last hope.\nNow its time to break for sleep to wake up on time to the exam hall.\nIn the exam hall, as I received the Thermodynamics question paper , I quickly noticed that I only had answers for three 1-mark questions and one 5-mark question.\nI acted like a AI tool 😉, decided to write those four answers at the beginning, Because first impression lasts long. From there, I began writing whatever came to mind, sometimes straying out of context and occasionally presenting contradictory views. However, I never left the answer paper blank, understanding that my duty was to perform, regardless of the outcome being beyond my control.\nThis is how the renowned Gen AI tools are Behaving these days 📝\nOn result day, I wasn’t particularly worried, as I understood the potential outcomes. However, like any normal human, I still felt a sense of hope. Coincidentally, I had passed with a C-grade, which was beyond my expectations. Now I realized the power and sweet spot. And the history repeats.\nMoral of the story:\nGen AI Is immature now so use Responsively.

However, if these expressions are not properly validated, they can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.\nThis type of attack is known as path traversal, and it can be used to access files that are outside of the intended directory structure. For example, an attacker could provide a path expression that includes a “../” sequence, which would cause the application to traverse up one directory level. This could allow the attacker to access files that they would not otherwise be able to see.\nPath traversal attacks can also be used to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. For example, an attacker could provide a path expression that includes a “..” sequence in a web form. If the application does not properly validate the input, the attacker could use this to access the application’s filesystem.\nTo prevent path traversal attacks, it is important to properly validate all user input that is used to construct path expressions. This can be done by using a regular expression to ensure that the input only contains valid characters. Additionally, it is important to restrict the access that users have to sensitive files and directories.\nHere are some tips for preventing path traversal attacks:\n\nBy following these tips, you can help to protect your applications from path traversal attacks.\nHere are some examples of path traversal attacks:\n\nCode:\nThis example illustrates how important it is to properly validate all user input that is used to construct path expressions.

However, this dependence on external resources can also create security vulnerabilities, one of which is Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). SSRF is a type of attack where an attacker manipulates a web application to send unauthorized requests to internal or external resources. In this blog, we will delve into the concept of SSRF, its potential impact on your Java applications, and discuss strategies to mitigate this critical security risk.\nWhat is Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)?\nServer-Side Request Forgery is a web application vulnerability that enables attackers to make unauthorized requests from the server-side, bypassing the security controls implemented on the client-side. The attacker typically tricks the application into sending HTTP requests to internal systems, other applications, or even external services.\nImpact of SSRF:\nThe consequences of a successful SSRF attack can be severe. Some of the potential risks include:\n\nJava Code Example:\nLet’s take a look at a simple Java code snippet that showcases an SSRF-vulnerable function:\n\nThe above code is a basic Java program that takes a URL as input and fetches its contents using an HTTP GET request. However, this code is susceptible to SSRF attacks, as it does not validate or sanitize the input URL. An attacker could provide a malicious URL that targets internal resources, thereby initiating an unauthorized request.\nSecuring Your Applications against SSRF:\nTo protect your applications from SSRF attacks, consider implementing the following security measures:\n\nTo fix the SSRF issue in the previous example, we need to validate the input URL to ensure it only points to allowed resources. We can implement a simple whitelist approach to restrict the URLs that our application is allowed to access. Here’s the updated Java code with the SSRF issue fixed:\n\nIn this updated code, we introduced a SecureSSRFExample class. We defined a ALLOWED_URLS array, which contains a list of trusted URLs that our application is allowed to access. The isUrlAllowed() function checks whether the provided URL starts with any of the allowed URLs. If the URL is present in the whitelist, the request will proceed; otherwise, an error message will be displayed, and the request will not be executed.\nBy using this whitelisting approach, we ensure that the application can only make requests to specified, trusted resources, effectively mitigating the SSRF vulnerability. It’s important to regularly review and update the whitelist to include new trusted URLs and remove any unnecessary entries. Additionally, consider implementing other security measures, such as input validation and using framework-level protections, to further enhance the security of your Java applications.\nConclusion:\nServer-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) can pose a significant threat to your Java applications, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, and security breaches. As a responsible developer, it is crucial to be aware of this vulnerability and implement best practices to secure your applications. By validating and sanitizing user input, employing whitelisting, and utilizing framework-level protections, you can reduce the risk of SSRF attacks and safeguard your application and data. Stay vigilant, keep your systems up to date, and adhere to secure coding practices to stay one step ahead of potential attackers.\n","id":"https://samirparhi.com/understanding-server-side-request-forgery/","title":"Uncontrolled Data Used in Path Expression: A Cyber Security Threat"},"https://samirparhi.com/variable-and-datatypes-in-rust/":{"body":"Variables are the basic building blocks of a programming language. It holds data in the computer memory during runtime. The data that a variable hold can be different types. Like other languages, Rust has 2 kinds of high-level data types. Scalar and Compound . Scalar contains a single value whereas Compound holds multi-value data in the memory during run time. the default data types are explained in the figure below:\nNow if you mark in the figure we use let keyword to declare a variable and the value of the variable is on the right side of the = symbol.\nIt is important to note that the variable in the rust is immutable (do not change the data once loaded) by default (why? please refer the part:0 of this series) However you can have the liberty to make it immutable by adding a mut keyword in front of any variable name. Example below:\n\nTo know what all are the different types of integers and floats please refer here.\nto print anything to the output console rust used println!() macro. in side println!() macro to extract the value of a variable you have to enclose the variable with {}. the sample is given below:\n\nlet’s know something more about Compound data types:\nArray operations:\n\nIn this part, we learnt the overview and a few operations on array and tuple. this is very easy and if you have learnt any programming language earlier this might be familiar to you. but as I told this series is for the beginner and comes in handy during the initial days.\nThank you for hopping in and see you in the next part.\n","id":"https://samirparhi.com/variable-and-datatypes-in-rust/","title":"Part 1: Variable and DataTypes in Rust"},"https://samirparhi.com/which-service-to-use-azure/":{"body":"Following aspects are taken in to account in this article:\n\nDeployment and administration:\nDeploying with the AKS is encapsulated still distributed. Which means all the workload stay inside the cluster and also the work space has a very fine grain separation with Namespaces. So In case of any issues related to workload it is quite easier to spot the bug because the issues lies in the same enclosed areas. However if we deploy in the app services , which is a black box for the developer or end user. Spotting of issue only lies on the logs that we obtain form the log stream which is time taking and tedious .  Some times log streams takes time to show the logs. and Sometime it does not show logs.  In the same line, if we deployment our Work load with AKS, we can have a upper-hand control of what we want to do in the system, With the help of open-source monitoring tool stack with (prometheus, loki and grafana) , we now have the each and every-log streamed our dash board for the near real time visualization (refresh rate 10s max). And also we can customize our metrics based on our requirement which is not doable by the azure metrics service.\nThe compute resource perspective:\nApp services essentially runs on app service plan. In the current scenario, The Maximum spec for the premium app service i,e  lets say P2V2  you will get max of 4 core and the cost is too high, will be discussing the cost part in the cost section. However, if you consider the price of P2V2  with V4 cpu you can build a very powerful AKS cluster which will perform better.\nDeployment and CI/CD :\nThe Deployment of the Kubernetes work loads are more controlled, It allows out-of-the-box deployment strategy (rolling update) to ensure there is zero-downtime. However this feature is there in The App service but that seems not to be that effective than  AKS.\nWorkload management in the AKS cluster (any Kubernetes cluster) is a beauty of migrating to Kubernetes. its brings better and fine-grained  auto scaling , POD lifecycle-management ,out of the box load-balancing capacity and more abstracted way to deploy your application and internal micro-service networking. You can even secure your AKS application in the way you want but few flexibility are restricted in app service.\nTo summarize, Management of the Azure workload are more effort less than the app services. More customization can be done to get most out of K8s cluster but limited in App service. You can not integrate different type of services with App service, in the other-hand most of the today’s services and workload are K8s compatible. Service-mesh, which provide a lots of functionality in today’s infrastructure word and mandatory to have in your infrastructure to address a lot of infrastructure common best practices are compatible with K8s but no with App services. When we tall about powerful  monitoring and logging system (Prometheus, loki, Grafana ) are pluggable or can be integrated seamlessly with K8s but it is bit tedious to integrate the monitoring stack with App Services. Form my point of view App services are not design for mid range Production grade Application however it is recommended to develop and test something in App-service for short term.\nCost analysis:\nIn App service , all the app services shares the same app service plan , which means they consume the resources defined in an app service plan. Think of a situation where you have increased no of app services that are not more accommodated in the existing app service plan, you may end of buying more app service plan which is a very costly option. In the same time you Kubernetes cluster can have a lot more capacity to deploy micro services in much much lesser price and you can even reduce this price lesser with better planning and opting for reserved instances like 1 year or 3 year Reserved instance which will reduce the cost to 60%\nBelow section elaborates the costing for AKS as well as App Service with Example:\nAKS Costing for various buying option:\nAKS is most cost effective as it does not charge on the Cluster management. It only charges for the node you use and the storage you use. Nodes are the basically VMs, One or more node combines together to create a VM scale set which in AKS term called as NodePool . You can always have a option to save money by choosing reserved instances which will save up to 60% cost.\nFor more info on VM price please visit to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/\nApp Services Buying option:\nyou can relate App Services to the ready made VM which has a common pool of compute resources. All the VM consumes the resource from a app service plan. For example if there is app service plan with  2 V cpu and 5 GB ram , and your are running 2 app services. If one app service is using 1.5 core of cpu and another workload now want to run and it needs at-least 1 core cpU then then the app can not work. in this case you have to by a new app-service plan. Autoscaling option is also not that effective as auto scaling effects on the app-service. So once you auto scale all the App-service will again start consuming which not a controlled way of resource management. Imp: Please not that there is no way you can reduce cost on App service as there is no concept of reserved resources like AKS.\nFor more info on App Service pricing visit to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/app-service/linux/\nValue Addition:\nThere are a lot of value addition when you use Kubernetes.\n• Be proud that you are using proven and test infrastructure architecture  used by the global Companies.\n• You will get a lot of Open source utility tool to work with Kubernetes cluster which will help to administrate the cluster  better, also increase your productivity and keeping your cluster healthy.\n• Fantastic community support , so that you wont feel left out .\n• Better management of your workload and its supporting component\n• You can drill down to the very details of your workload component to investigate . Nothing is Black-box\n• You can create your Custom controller for your specific need with is a feature from K8s.\nAs per the above analysis we can conclude that App service are good to start with but not ideal for real/ production workload and limited in various features. So moving to AKS/Kubernetes based workload deployment is more effective and smartest way to deliver superior product experience to end users.\nNow Let’s do your Bit:\n• As this is mentioned is a curated topic, I would encourage all the reader to add as many information here, so that it could be one stop information for the people.\n• Please comment if anything wrong and anything can be improved\n• Do let me know what you want me write next.\nHope this Help !!!\n","id":"https://samirparhi.com/which-service-to-use-azure/","title":"Which service to Use Azure Kubernetes Services or Azure App service (A curated topic)"},"https://samirparhi.com/why-i-was-encouraged-to-learn-rust/":{"body":"It is been 8 years in my Job career as an infrastructure/DevSecOps engineer, I am much satisfied. But in the corner of my heart, I had the urge to learn programming so that I can relate my daily job to the developer program easily.\nEveryone knows there are a lot of great programming languages and also suggested some. Finally, I was left with python and Rust. When I started comparing both the below fact sheet concluded that I should start investing my time in learning Rust.\nThe fact sheet:\nFacts\tRust\tPython\nLearning curve\tHigh (for a complete beginner)\tEasy to learn\nExecution speed\tHigh\tMuch lower\nMemory Management\tExceptional (no need for garbage collector)\tLower than\nsyntax\tStatically typed.\tplain English\nCreating System tools\tVery much recommend\tNot Recommended\nPopular in Developer\t#1\t#3\nStability\tHigh\tlow\nDocumentation\tsufficient\tSufficient\nPre-existing module\tless (Developing)\tA lot (plug and play)\ntype\tLow level\tHigh level\nOut of all these comparisons, I loved the way Rust manage the Memory and the art behind the failsafe. I have heard of the pain of developers when it comes to the performance of the application and performing the right way to collect the garbage, it is no more in Rust. I was also fascinated to know how the most amazing tool like Kubernetes is programmed, So Rust was the right choice for me to take up. Though I know I will be starting programming from the scratch, and there will be a huge learning curve this year, I would try to learn as much as possible.\nAt the same time, I will be publishing my learning note as I progress with a self-assessment so that it would provide the reader with more insight.\nStay tuned in this series to learn along with me. Let’s be closer to the system a bit more.\nNote: The above opinions are solely my personal views\n","id":"https://samirparhi.com/why-i-was-encouraged-to-learn-rust/","title":"Why I was encouraged to learn Rust (Comparing Rust and Python"}},"docInfo":{"https://samirparhi.com/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://samirparhi.com/configuring-meshery-behind-istio-ingress-gateway/":{"body":363,"title":6},"https://samirparhi.com/creating-a-aks-private-cluster-with-application-gateway-and-istio/":{"body":1125,"title":7},"https://samirparhi.com/cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability-and-mitigation-in-web-applications/":{"body":106,"title":8},"https://samirparhi.com/dependencies-tale/":{"body":228,"title":7},"https://samirparhi.com/devsecops-pipeline-setup-for-fully-automated-deployment/":{"body":200,"title":6},"https://samirparhi.com/few-facts-about-rust-programming-language/":{"body":49,"title":6},"https://samirparhi.com/imposing-mandatory-http-s-security-headers-in-nginx/":{"body":292,"title":8},"https://samirparhi.com/mastering-the-art-of-pivot/":{"body":369,"title":7},"https://samirparhi.com/parameters-to-consider-while-choosing-an-open-source-tool/":{"body":22,"title":6},"https://samirparhi.com/protecting-apps-from-sql-injection/":{"body":407,"title":8},"https://samirparhi.com/recursion-in-rust/":{"body":243,"title":5},"https://samirparhi.com/sbom-source-of-truth/":{"body":420,"title":5},"https://samirparhi.com/securing-meshery-installation/":{"body":225,"title":5},"https://samirparhi.com/shell-script-for-migrating-azure-container-registry/":{"body":88,"title":6},"https://samirparhi.com/shell-script-to-remove-history-from-a-git-branch/":{"body":105,"title":6},"https://samirparhi.com/statically-typed-and-dynamically-typed-programing-language-intro/":{"body":497,"title":8},"https://samirparhi.com/success/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://samirparhi.com/the-gen-ai-tools-made-my-college-days-alive/":{"body":482,"title":7},"https://samirparhi.com/the-plan/":{"body":182,"title":1},"https://samirparhi.com/uncontrolled-data-used-in-path-expression-a-cyber-security-threat/":{"body":221,"title":8},"https://samirparhi.com/understanding-server-side-request-forgery/":{"body":330,"title":8},"https://samirparhi.com/variable-and-datatypes-in-rust/":{"body":147,"title":5},"https://samirparhi.com/which-service-to-use-azure/":{"body":653,"title":10},"https://samirparhi.com/why-i-was-encouraged-to-learn-rust/":{"body":176,"title":6}},"length":25},"lang":"English"}
